# CodeAlpha Task Two: Handwritten Character Recognition

## Overview
This repository contains a handwritten character recognition system developed to recognize various handwritten characters or alphabets. The system can be extended to recognize entire words or sentences as well. 

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is available on Kaggle: [Handwriting Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/landlord/handwriting-recognition). Make sure to download and preprocess the dataset before running the recognition system.

## Usage
To use the handwritten character recognition system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle and preprocess it as necessary.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `Handwritten_Character_Recognition.ipynb`.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the recognition model, and test its performance.
5. Experiment with different algorithms and parameters to optimize the recognition accuracy.

## Results
The recognition accuracy of the model can vary depending on factors such as the quality of the dataset, preprocessing techniques, and the chosen recognition algorithm. Results will be provided in the notebook after training and testing the model.

## Future Work
This project can be extended in various ways, including:
- Recognizing entire words or sentences.
- Improving model accuracy through advanced preprocessing techniques and algorithms.
- Deploying the recognition system as a web or mobile application for real-time usage.
